## Chapter 4 - Exercise 14

You are given a strongly connected directed graph G = (V, E) with positive edge weights along
with a particular node v0 E V . Give an efficient algorithm for finding shortest paths between all
pairs of nodes, with the one restriction that these paths must all pass through v0.

## Running solution

```sh
python passing.py <v0> <from> <to>
```

Python dependencies:
- networkx
- matplotlib
