# Algorithms - Papadimitriou

## Chapter 5 - Exercise 27
Alice wants to throw a party and is deciding whom to call. She has n people to choose from, and
she has made up a list of which pairs of these people know each other. She wants to pick as many
people as possible, subject to two constraints: at the party, each person should have at least five
other people whom they know and five other people whom they donâ€™t know.

Give an efficient algorithm that takes as input the list of n people and the list of pairs who know
each other and outputs the best choice of party invitees. Give the running time in terms of n.

## Running solution

```sh
python party.py <minimum_number_of_friends> <must_not_know_at_least>
```
